# Record Store Challenge API
## Description

This is a **NestJS** application starter with MongoDB integration. If necessary, it provides a script to boot a Mongo emulator for Docker. This setup includes end-to-end tests, unit tests, test coverage, linting, and database setup with data from `data.json`.

## Installation

### Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
````
### copy and update env variables
copie the env variables in the .env.example and update the values. For the `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` and `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` you can use `admin` but feel free to change it.

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
````
### Docker for MongoDB Emulator, Redis and Rabbit MQ
To use all the docker containers Emulator, you can start it using Docker:
```
npm run container:start
```
This will start the following docker contanains (MongoDB, Redis, and Rabbit MQ) instance running on your local machine. You can customize the settings in the Docker setup bsy modifying the docker-compose-mongo.yml if necessary. In the current configuration, you will have a MongoDB container running, which is accessible at localhost:27017.
This mongo url will be necessary on the .env file, with example as follows:

```
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/records
```
This will point your application to a local MongoDB instance.

### MongoDB Data Setup
The data.json file contains example records to seed your database. The setup script will import the records from this file into MongoDB.

To set up the database with the example records:

```
npm run setup:db
```
This will prompt the user to cleanup (Y/N) existing collection before importing data.json


#### data.json Example
Hereâ€™s an example of the data.json file that contains records:
```
[
    {
        "artist": "Foo Fighters",
        "album": "Foo Fighers",
        "price": 8,
        "qty": 10,
        "format": "CD",
        "category": "Rock",
        "mbid": "d6591261-daaa-4bb2-81b6-544e499da727"
  },
  {
        "artist": "The Cure",
        "album": "Disintegration",
        "price": 23,
        "qty": 1,
        "format": "Vinyl",
        "category": "Alternative",
        "mbid": "11af85e2-c272-4c59-a902-47f75141dc97"
  },
]
```

### Running the App
#### Development Mode
To run the application in development mode (with hot reloading):

```
npm run start:dev
```
#### Production Mode
To build and run the app in production mode:

```
npm run start:prod
```

### Tests
#### Run Unit Tests
To run unit tests:

```
npm run test
```
To run unit tests with code coverage:

```
npm run test:cov
```
This will show you how much of your code is covered by the unit tests.
#### Run End-to-End Tests
To run end-to-end tests:
```
npm run test:e2e
```
Run Tests with Coverage


Run Linting
To check if your code passes ESLint checks:

```
npm run lint
```
This command will show you any linting issues with your code.


### admin Dashboard
there is a simple dashboard to upload records and view records. Right it only works locally at the root of the page ('http://localhost:3000/') as the backend is not hosted. Onclick of each record will open a slide menu with all the list of tracks. try updating any record and with a valid mbid to see how it works.
